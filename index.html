        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Jada Strider and I am currently a student at the University of California-Riverside. I am currently a first year studying Pre-Business to hopefully get into the school of business to pursue business management. I have been taking 12 units per quarter.   April 9, 2021, the day I passed my California State driving test. My dad was right next to me as we shared the milestone moment together. The excitement and energy I was feeling in that specific moment was simply unforgettable. I grew up constantly having little to zero patience, and little did I know, that would have a large influence on the way I drove. It was easy to say I was a reckless driver who always seemed to be in a rush everywhere I would go. 



<br><br>

        Last quarter the classes I took were BUS101, Philosophy 008, and English 4. These classes got me a 3.0 gpa. This quarter I decided to take Math, ENG 1A, CS008, and MS005. I have been juggling these classes better than the ones I signed up for last quarter. I currently have a 4.0 gpa. he excitement and energy I was feeling in that specific moment was simply unforgettable. I grew up constantly having little to zero patience, and little did I know, that would have a large influence on the way I drove. It was easy to say I was a reckless driver who always seemed to be in a rush everywhere I would go. I never did recognize the fact that I was putting myself and others around me in extreme danger. My mother always reminded me to slow down because she feared me getting into an accident one day. Her mother died in a car accident and it had remained a fear of hers for it to happen to any of her remaining family members. I never took her words into consideration, until one day, it all caught up to me. 
The most important thing I had, I lost in my final year of highschool.

<br><br>

        
After I get my business degree in management, I hope to attend law school in the following years. I want to get into Santa Clara University Law School and become a corporate lawyer.I plan to take the rigorous courses that they assign to me and accomplish this goal that I have been dreaming of since I was 11 years old watching numerous shows with top lawyers.They show their smartness, dominance, and authority, all future aspects I want in my future life.  April 9, 2021, the day I passed my California State driving test. My dad was right next to me as we shared the milestone moment together. All of my hard work and preparation during the off-season fell down the drain. I had nothing that I was able to do about it besides taking my car accident as a learning lesson, stop being an impulsive person, and do not always rush while driving. My track season being taken away was the consequence that I felt most out of this accident, and without it, I probably wouldn't have made this much of a change for myself. As I look back on this story it makes me realize the ways this accident has shaped me into who I am today. I no longer feel comfortable with friends driving fast because it will always bring me back to that moment. I no longer go above 75 mph on the freeway and sometimes, even that feels way too fast.
